CONQUER: Reinforcement Learning from Reformulations in Conversational QA over KGs
============

Description
------------
## Optimizing Entity Detection
To optimise the Entity Detection the Lexical Match using Jaccard overlap is replaced by Bert model. Using Cosine similarity the similarity between the set of
words in the node label of 𝑛 and all words in 𝑞𝑡 (with stopwords excluded) is calculated. \\
The goal is to optimise the starting points.
